# Facial-Recognition-Sklearn
Using Python and the Anaconda Spyder IDE, I created a program that prints out accuracies using the Sklearn Dataset fetch_lfw_people. I applied six different classifiers, parameters such as PCA, and manipulated the number of samples that appeared in the final results and edited the train test split ratio to improve accuracy artifically. 

MLProject.py is the code the code that logs accuricies to the console
FacialRecognitionResearchPaper.docx is my research paper and final project report for my Machine Learning course.

Classifiers used:
K-Nearest_Neighbors KNN
Random Forests RF
Naive Bayes NB
Decision Trees DT
Multi-Layer Perceptron MLP (Neural Network)
Support Vector / Classifier SVC

Parameters:
PCA

Code and paper written alongside my group partner, named in the research paper.
