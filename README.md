# Facial-Recognition-Sklearn
Using the Anaconda Spyder IDE, I created a program that prints out accuracies using the Sklearn Dataset fetch_lfw_people. I applied six different classifiers, parameters such as PCA, and manipulated the number of samples that appeared in the final results and edited the train test split ratio to improve accuracy artifically.
